A Star Wars-themed "hangman"-style game where the user has 7 guesses to pick the letters in a randomly chosen Star Wars character's name.

If a user guesses all of the letters correctly, a winning message appears. A titled image of the character appears and their theme music plays. The number of wins is updated at the bottom of the stage area.

If a user runs out of guesses before guessing all of the letters correctly, a losing message appears. A mocking image of Salacious Crumb appears and the Cantina Band music plays.

Music can be toggled on/off at any point during the game.

## Characters Included

16 Star Wars characters were included in the game:

- Anakin Skywalker
- Boba Fett
- Chewbacca
- Darth Maul
- Darth Sidious
- Darth Tyranus
- Darth Vader
- Han Solo
- Jar Jar Binks
- Lando Calrissian
- Luke Skywalker
- Obi-Wan Kenobi
- Padme Amidala
- Princess Leia
- Qui-Gon Jinn
- Yoda

## Concepts Used

This is a straightforward game built with fundamental Javascript concepts:

- variables
- arrays
- objects
- functions
- if/else statements
- for loops
- methods
- DOM manipulation
- events

## Limitations

This game uses the keyup event to capture user input and is currently limited to gameplay on desktop/laptop devices. A future area of exploration would be to add one of the following:

1. A virtual keyboard that appears on smaller screens to capture user input
2. An input field to capture user input

This input could then be passed through a function in a similar way to how the keyup event function works.

## Built With
