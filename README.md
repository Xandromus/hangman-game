Week 3 Assignment: Create a simple hangman game using vanilla Javascript

## Description

![Star Wars Hangman Game](https://xandromus.github.io/responsive-portfolio/assets/images/starwars.png)

A Star Wars-themed "hangman"-style game where the user has 7 guesses to pick the letters in a random Star Wars character's name.

If a user guesses all of the letters correctly, a winning message appears. A titled image of the character appears and their theme music plays. The number of wins is updated at the bottom of the stage area.

If a user runs out of guesses before guessing all of the letters correctly, a losing message appears. A mocking image of Salacious Crumb appears and the Cantina Band music plays.

Music can be toggled on/off at any point during the game.
